BF3 Hardcore Infantry Only Plugin for BigBrotherBot
===================================================

http://www.bigbrotherbot.net

Description
-----------

This plugin makes your BF3 server infantry only and hardcore, and yet your server
is still listed as a Hardcore server in Battlelog. 

**Q** : *What is the advantage of having this plugin?*

**A** : *When you disable vehicles in a Hardcore setup, (i.e. if you want to run
a hardcore infantry only server) your server is listed as a "Custom" server in 
battlelog. BF3 players generally do not search for servers with custom settings 
thus your server is hardly displayed in search results.*
  
**With this plugin, although vehicles are disabled, your server is still listed 
as "Hardcore" thus you have more chance increasing your server traffic.**

**NOTE:** This plugin works only for Battlefield 3
