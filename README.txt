Description
-----------

This plugin makes your BF3 server infantry only and hardcore, and yet your server
is still listed as a Hardcore server in Battlelog. 

Q: What is the advantage of having this plugin?

A: When you disable vehicles in a Hardcore setup, (i.e. if you want to run
   a hardcore infantry only server) your server is listed as a "Custom" server in 
   battlelog. BF3 players generally do not search for servers with custom settings 
   thus your server is hardly displayed in search results.
  
   With this plugin, although vehicles are disabled, your server is still listed 
   as "Hardcore" thus you have more chance increasing your server traffic.

NOTE: This plugin works only for Battlefield 3
